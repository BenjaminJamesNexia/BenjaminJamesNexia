- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenjaminJamesNexia.  I work for an Amazing Audit firm that focuses on smallish businesses, and really empowers it's staff to deliver outside the box.
- 👀 I’m interested in building software to help clients work smarter.  Software thats reasonably priced and built on solid open source libraries like Spring Boot and Flutter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Hungarian using DuoLingo
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building robots to automate physical things - once I get the volume I will push some dollars towards the hardware side.
- 📫 How to reach me - not sure - does GitHub do anything useful for this?
